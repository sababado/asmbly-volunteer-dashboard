# Asmbly Volunteer Dashboard Frontend

The main React application for the Volunteer Dashboard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Generic npm/npx

### Running the Frontend Separately

You can run the frontend application independently of the backend or UI kit (though it depends on the UI kit package).

#### From the Project Root
```bash
npm run dev -w @asmbly/frontend
```

#### From this Directory (`apps/frontend`)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building
```bash
npm run build
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```
